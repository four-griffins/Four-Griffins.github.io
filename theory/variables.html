<h2>Variables and Expressions</h2>
<p>
Before we start calculating things, we first need to learn how to create data
to perform the calculations on. This is done with <span class='themable
class'>variables</span>, a concept that exists in every single programming
language there is. Let's take a look at an example.
</p><dart>
main() {
  int amountOfLegs = 2;
  print(amountOfLegs);

  amountOfLegs = 4;
  print(amountOfLegs);
}
</dart><div class='themable remark'>
Remember, if a variable name is multiple words, they are glued together, and
the first word is lowercase while the rest is uppercase. So "amount of legs"
becomes "<span style='color: #55b'>a</span>mount<span style='color: #b44'>O</span>f<span style='color: #b44'>L</span>egs".
</div><p>
There are 4 statements in this code. In the first one, we create a variable named <code>amountOfLegs</code> and give it a value
of 2. Note that in programming, a single = sign means assigning a value to a
variable, and the variable is always on the left while the value is on the
right. After printing our variable, we give it a new value and then print it again. If you try this code on Dartpad, you will notice that the 2 <code>print</code> statements will produce the values 2 and 4 respectively.
</p>
<h3>Data Types</h3>
<p>
In some languages, that's where the story ends: you create variables by giving
them a name, and a value. Those languages are called dynamically typed. But
Dart, like many other languages, is statically typed, which means that whenever
you create a variable, you have to specify what type of data it stores, and you
can only store values of that type. In the example above, this is done with the
word <code class='themable class'>int</code>. This specifies that
<code>amountOfLegs</code> can store integer values (integers are whole numbers).
Let's take this code as an example:
</p><dart>
main() {
  int amountOfLegs = "hello";
  int count = 4.3;
}
</dart><p>
Dart would refuse to run this code, because <code class='themable
string'>"hello"</code> is a <code class='themable class'>String</code>, and
<code>amountOfLegs</code> only accepts values of type <code class='themable
class'>int</code>. Similarly, <code>count</code> would fail, because <code
class='themable literal'>4.3</code> is not an <code class='themable
class'>int</code>.
</p><p>
So what types are there? Well, there are a few built-in types that we can use.
<ul>
  <li><code class='themable class'>int</code>, which stores integer values like
    <code class='themable literal'>47</code>, <code class='themable
      literal'>-905</code> and <code class='themable literal'>0</code>.</li>
  <li><code class='themable class'>double</code>, which can store floating
    point values like <code class='themable literal'>3.14</code>. Its name is
    derived from the fact that it takes twice as much memory space to store a
  single value compared to the <code class='themable class'>int</code>.</li>
  <li><code class='themable class'>bool</code>, which stores exactly 2 possible
  values: <code class='themable literal'>true</code> and <code class='themable
literal'>false</code>. These are used to create conditions, in case you only
want to run code in certain circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<code class='themable class'>String</code>s are actually not a standard type;
you can tell because its name starts with a capital, unlike the others I
mentioned. <code class='themable class'>String</code> is actually a class. We
will learn more about classes later, but in short, they are types that you can
create yourself, so you can store any kind of data you want. Just like the
<code>print</code> function, the <code class='themable class'>String</code>
class is provided by Dart automatically.
</p>
<div class='themable remark'>
<h3>The <code class='themable keyword'>var</code> keyword</h3>
<p>
There is another datatype-related keyword: <code class='themable
  keyword'>var</code>. You can use <code class='themable keyword'>var</code>
in place of the datatype when creating variables, and Dart will try to guess
what type your variable needs to be based on what values you give it. (It's
quite accurate, although in more complicated situations it might pull some
shenanigans.) Although it's best practice to always specify the type of a
variable, it can occasionally be nice when the type is very long, or if you are
just too lazy to type it :P .
</p>
</div>
<h3>Expressions</h3>
<p>
Now we know that assigning variables works in the following pattern:
<dart> <name> = <value>; </dart>
But the &lt;value> part is a lot more flexible than just typing an actual
value. You can put anything you want there, as long as it can ultimately be
resolved to a single value of the right type. For example, you can put a long
calculation there.
<dart>
main() {
  double a = (4 + 3) * 7.7 / 2.5 - 15;
}
</dart>
This whole calculation can be reduced to a single floating-point number, so
Dart will perform the calculation and assign the result to <code>a</code>. Even
better, we can also use variables in those calculations:
<dart>
main() {
  int x = 4;
  int y = 2 * x + 5; // results to y = 13
}
</dart>
Expressions also exist for other types, outside numbers. Here are some examples:
<dart>
main() {
  String greeting = "Hello" + "world" + "!";
  print(greeting); // Helloworld!

  bool finished = true && ((false || true) != true);
  print(finished); // false
}
</dart>
</p>
<h3>Scope</h3>
<p>
The curly braces of functions have another use, besides grouping together parts
of code. They also define a <b>scope</b>. A scope is an environment, in which
certain variables are valid and can be used. When you define a variable, it is
bound to the nearest scope that it is in, so if you define a variable in the
main function, you can use it in the main function. However, scopes stack, so
if you create a scope within a scope, you can use variables in the outer scope
from within the inner scope - but not the other way around!
<dart>
main() {
  String a = "outer";
  print(a);

  {
    // we can create a scope by adding these braces.
    // it's not very useful, but you can do it if you need to

    print(a);
    // a is valid here, it's from the scope around this one

    String b = "inner";
    print(b);
    // we can use b here, it's in the same scope as where it's created

  } // &lt;-- the inner scope ends here, b is no longer valid to use

  print(b);
  // error! We can't use b here, it's not defined in this scope
}
</dart>
</p>
